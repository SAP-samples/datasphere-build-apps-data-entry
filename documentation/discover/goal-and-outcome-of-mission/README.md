## Example Business Scenario

A tank farm in the midstream oil and gas industry is interested to see the product level indicators for each of their tanks. They need actual tank volumes on each tank. For some tanks the company uses IOT sensors to automatically read tank levels. But the other tanks are scattered across the field and need a manual reading and updating by a field technician. This helps the company to determine if they will be able to meet their product orders at a glance. 

1. Front End Application is built using SAP Build Apps for data feed.
2. The data is stored into HANA cloud which is underneath the SAP Datasphere.
3. Analytical Data modeling happens in Datasphere.
4. Dashboard is created in SAC.
